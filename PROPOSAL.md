**"Lyrical Hangman" by Neha Prabhu, 2019**

_Project Description :_ 

A Hangman game using popular songs of artists as the lines user must guess. 
The artist will be displayed, and the song title will be taken. Some of the letters will be 
filled and others left blank for the user to guess the song. 
With every wrong letter guess an additional part of the "hangman" will be added. If the 
user completes his/her tries and still does not guess the lyric correctly the hangman 
will be complete and the user will lose. If he/she guesses the correct lyric while the 
hangman is still incomplete the user will win.

_Features :_

1. Graphics to display the hangman image and the blanks according to the title displayed
2. The SpotifyPublicAPI will be used to maintain a database of song titles and artists and 
   the data from this API will be used to retrieve information.
3. Sounds whenever something is added to the hangman.
4. Qt GUI

//animating the person
//play the song if the user gets it correct
//bar that tracks the dying dude.
//filter by explicit (use an API to detect bad words)

_Proposal Timeline:_

Before April 12:

1. Familiarize myself with getting images to display on screen (the hangman image), and learn how 
to integrate the API. 
2. Come up with a structured plan for the project

April 12 â€“ April 19 :

1. Finish the API integration and make sure title of the artist shows up, with some letters of 
the song showing up.
2. Make sure user input works - user enters letters guessed and the word box from which user
can pick letters should get rid of the picked letters. Also, guessed letters should be displayed
and letters left to guess should also be displayed.
3. With each wrong guess, a part should be added to hangman.

April 19 - 26 :

1. If bugs are there from the previous part, fix those.
2. Display win message and check over every possible condition for winning or losing. 
3. Incorporate any extra graphics.


Extra Information :

Knowledge of JSON data retrieving will help with this project.
